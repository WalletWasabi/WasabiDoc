# Use of Wasabi

## General

::::details
### How do I generate a new wallet?

You can [generate as many new wallets](/using-wasabi/WalletGeneration.md) as you'd like, for no extra cost and without asking for permission.
Go to the `Wallet Manager` tab and the `Generate Wallet` menu.
As with everything in Wasabi, you are required to label this new wallet.
Make sure that you are precise so that you know what this wallet is for.
The password is used to encrypt the private key (extracted from the extended private key) on the computer.

:::danger Careful!!
Without knowledge of the password, you CANNOT spend your bitcoin!!
:::

Make sure that you properly back up and write down this password.
Please also read and agree to the [terms and conditions, the privacy policy and the legal statement](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi/Legal/Assets/LegalDocumentsWw2.txt).
Now you can continue with clicking `Generate`.

![Generate new wallet in Wasabi](/WalletManagerGenerateWallet.png "Generate new wallet in Wasabi")

Now you will see the 12 recovery words, this is the mnemonic seed that you can use to back up and recover your wallet.
Make sure, and triple-check that you have done a proper backup of BOTH the password AND the mnemonic.
When you only have the recovery words, but not the password, then you will NOT be able to recover your wallet.
In order to protect your paper backup, consider storing the password and recovery words in two different locations.
You have successfully setup your wallet when you click `I wrote down my Recovery Words!`

![Wasabi Wallet recovery words](/AddWalletRecoveryWords.png "Wasabi Wallet recovery words")

::::details
### Can I rename my Wallet?

Yes you can.
To access the `Wallets` folder type `Wallet Folder` in the search bar at the top of the main view and rename the .json Wallet file.
Or you can navigate to the `Wallets` folder (inside the [Wasabi data folder](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.md#where-can-i-find-the-wasabi-data-folder)) and rename the .json Wallet file.
Then go to `WalletBackups` folder (inside [Wasabi data folder](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.md#where-can-i-find-the-wasabi-data-folder)) and rename the .json Wallet file.

:::tip
You need to mark the “show hidden files” setting to see the Wasabi data folder.
:::

:::warning
To avoid problems, make sure you close Wasabi Wallet before proceeding to rename any of your wallets.
:::
::::

::::details
### What is the password used for?

The password you set is used:
* As a 13th word (passphrase) as described in [BIP 39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).
* To encrypt the private key of the extended private key as described in [BIP 38](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) to get an encrypted secret which is stored on the computer.

Wasabi stores only the BIP38 encrypted blob, so you'll need to type in the password to open the wallet and to spend from Wasabi.

:::danger
The password will unlock your bitcoin to anyone who has access to the recovery words backup or the computer!
If your backup gets compromised, this password is the only thing protecting your precious sats.
:::
::::

::::details
### What password should I use?

:::danger
It is **VERY** important to use a [random and long password](/using-wasabi/PasswordBestPractices.md).
:::

Since it is very difficult for humans to generate true randomness, it is good to use a tool to help find a strong password.
This can be the [Diceware english wordlist](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases) for true off-line password generation.
A secure password manager software might also be used, but be careful here.
::::

::::details
### Where can I find the Wasabi data folder?

You can easily reach it from inside Wasabi by typing `Data Folder` in the search bar at the top of the main view.

Or you can manually navigate to it (depending on which OS you have):

* Windows: `/Users/{your username}/AppData/Roaming/WalletWasabi/Client`
* Linux: `/home/{your username}/.walletwasabi/client`
* macOS: `/Users/{your username}/.walletwasabi/client`

:::tip
You need to mark the “show hidden files” setting to see it.
:::
::::

::::details
### Can I spend my bitcoin without the password?

:::danger
NO!!!
Without knowledge of your password, even when you have the wallet file and recovery words, you CANNOT spend your bitcoin!
:::

When creating a new wallet, after labeling it properly, the next step is to select a long and random password.
Every time you want to spend your coins from Wasabi, you MUST provide this password.
So even if you have these words securely engraved in metal, without the password, you cannot restore the backup of your wallet.

:::tip
Always back up your mnemonic recovery words, and your password in two separate secure locations.
:::
::::

:::details
### Why BIP 38?

[BIP 38](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) is a good standard, a well-tested and very secure way to encrypt a private key.
It is also implemented in the [NBitcoin library](https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitcoin), which is used by Wasabi.
Additionally, there is no standard way (BIP) to encrypt HD wallets.
Take into account that it is not only encryption what BIP 38 provides but also a brute-force protection.
:::

:::details
### What are the terms and conditions?

The most important parts of the legal documents are summarized in the following points:
- The service is open-source under the MIT license.
- The service is provided on a non-custodial basis.
Safekeeping of keys are the sole responsibility of the user.
- The user is solely responsible to act according to their local laws and regulations.
- We do not store any personally identifiable information.
Moreover, our trustless software architecture prevents us from gathering this information in the first place.
- A transaction fee is only charged by the service provider for CoinJoin transactions.
- We only provide written support, and NEVER ask for recovery words, passwords or similar security critical information.

:::

:::details
### Can I import a watch-only extended public key?

Yes, but not yet in the GUI, you will need to manually create a new wallet file.

Open a text editor and paste the following wallet structure:

```
{
  "EncryptedSecret": null,
  "ChainCode": null,
  "MasterFingerprint": null,
  "ExtPubKey": "",
  "PasswordVerified": true,
  "MinGapLimit": 21,
  "AccountKeyPath": "84'/0'/0'",
  "BlockchainState": {
    "Network": "Main",
    "Height": "0"
  },
  "HdPubKeys": [
  ]
}
```

Then paste your extended public key in-between the quotes of the field `"ExtPubKey": "paste xpub here",`.

You can also change the `"AccountKeyPath": "84'/0'/0'",` field if you want to import a different derivation path.
But notice that Wasabi only works with native SegWit bech32 addresses.

Save this file in your [`Wallets` data folder](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.html#where-can-i-find-the-wasabi-data-folder) as a json file like this: `WalletName.json`.
The `WalletName` will be displayed in the GUI.

Then start Wasabi and load the wallet to synchronize it.

For watch only wallets, the `Send` tab is disabled.
:::

:::details
### What does the privacy progress mean?

The privacy progress tile represents the percentage of how private the wallet is.
It considers the anonymity score weighted amounts instead of just amounts that reached the anonymity score threshold.
The private value is the total amount that reached the anonscore threshold.
:::

:::details
### What does the bar with the colored segments mean?

The colored segments make up the `Privacy Bar`.
The Privacy Bar is supposed to give the user an easy overview of the wallet's coins and it's privacy progress, where each segment represents a coin.
The color of each segment indicates if that coin is private (green), semi-private (orange), or non-private (red).

![Wasabi Wallet Privacy Bar](/PrivacyBar.png "Wasabi Wallet Privacy Bar")

So according to the image, this wallet has 46 coins of which 21 are private (green), 11 are semi-private (orange) and 14 are non-private (red).
:::

:::details
### How can I display the fee in sats?

By default, the wallet displays all fees in BTC (mining fees, coinjoin fees etc.).
This can be changed to sats in the `Settings`.
Go to `Settings` -> `General` -> `Fee display unit` and change it to `sats`.

![Wasabi Wallet Fee Display Unit](/FeeDisplayUnit.png "Wasabi Wallet Fee Display Unit")
:::

## Synchronization

:::details
### What are BIP-158 block filters?

A [BIP-158 block filter](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki) is a data structure that contains a hash of all the addresses referenced in a block.
It is much smaller than the whole block itself.
The Wasabi coordinator generates these block filters, and sends them out to any wallet that requests them.
A wallet client checks locally if the block filter matches any of the addresses in the wallet.
If not, then the filter is stored for later reference and for syncing new wallets.
If yes, then the wallet connects to a random Bitcoin peer-to-peer full node over Tor to request this entire block.
:::

:::details
### How does Wasabi download a relevant block?

There are two ways Wasabi can get a block:

1. If you are connected to [your own full node](/using-wasabi/BitcoinFullNode.md) then it will fetch the block from there.

2. By default from a random Bitcoin P2P node, connected through a new Tor identity only for this one download request.

Read more [ħere](/using-wasabi/WalletLoad.md)
:::

:::details
### How do I know if the synchronization is finished?

Once Tor and backend are properly connected and you have peers, you will see a checkmark at the bottom right corner of the main view.
The timer of the loading wallet page runs out when all the block filters and all the relevant blocks are downloaded and the wallet is synchronized.

![Wasabi Wallet Status Bar](/WalletSynchronizing.png "Wasabi Wallet Status Bar")
:::

:::details
### How long does the initial, and a subsequent synchronization take?

It usually only takes a couple of seconds to scan the block filters, and to download and parse the blocks.
However, for large wallets with many transactions, this synchronization can take up to several hours.
The speed and reliability of the loading process is constantly improved.
For especially old wallets, it might be worth considering to generate a new wallet with a shorter transaction history.
:::

:::details
### Can Wasabi work with a pruned bitcoin node?

No.
Wasabi client doesn't work with pruned nodes.
:::

## Receive

::::details
### Why is it bad to re-use addresses?

Bitcoin is designed so that for every payment you can use a new address that is not tied to any of your previous addresses.
When you use a new address for every coin, then it becomes much much more difficult to find out that these coins are yours.
However, when you use [the same address for every coin](/why-wasabi/AddressReuse.md), then everyone knows that all coins can be spent by one individual who has the private key - you!
Thus, when someone finds out that you control this address, maybe you published it in your social media profile for donations, or you sent a coin to another peer who knows you, then he knows also how many bitcoin you have in that same address.
Take good care to whom you tell your addresses, and every time use a different address.

Every time a coin is received, the address is removed from the GUI so that you are not tempted to use it again.

Wasabi uses [BIP 44 multi-account hierarchy for deterministic wallets](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) so that you can generate countless addresses and have them all securely backed-up in the 12 recovery words.

:::danger
**NEVER RE-USE ADDRESSES**
:::
::::

:::details
### How do I generate a new receiving address?

You can generate a new bech32 address in the `Receive` dialog of Wasabi Wallet.
First you must set a label for it, so that you later know who knows that this address is yours.
Be precise in the label of the observers who know this address is yours, as this is an important part of good [coin selection](/why-wasabi/Coins.md) privacy best practices.
Do not write anything else on the label exept the name of the entities that know this address belongs to you.
Then you can click on `Continue` which will now show you the address, and you can copy it to the clipboard.
After a coin has been sent to this address, it is removed from the GUI.
This is a good feature to help protect you against [address reuse](/why-wasabi/AddressReuse.md).

![Wasabi Wallet Known By label](/ReceiveLabelingRequired.png "Wasabi Wallet Known By label")
:::

:::details
### Where can I find previously generated addresses?

Generated addresses which haven't received any funds yet, are displayed at the `Unused Receive Addresses` list.
Click on the `Receive` button > `Unused Receive Addresses`

![Unused Receive Addresses](/UnusedReceiveAddresses.png "Unused Receive Addresses")
:::

:::details
### What is the gap limit?

The gap limit is the maximum number of consecutive unused addresses that your wallet will generate when recovering it.
Wasabi automatically increases this value if needed when you generate new receiving addresses.
When you import the wallet file into a new Wasabi client, then it will use this `MinGapLimit` to find your coins in the wallet.
:::

:::details
### How do I change the gap limit of a wallet?

You can change the gap limit of an already existing Wasabi wallet by editing the wallet file.
Open the wallet folder by typing `Wallet Folder` in the search bar.
Then, open the wallet file in your favourite text editor.

Close Wasabi and edit the `MinGapLimit` setting (which is `21` by default) in the wallet file.
The value depends on the settings of other tools that use the wallet too (e.g. use `100` for [BTCPay Server](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/FAQ/FAQ-Wallet/#missing-payments-in-my-software-or-hardware-wallet)).

You might also need to reset the height of your wallet, so that it gets reindexed.
This can be done by setting the `BlockchainState->Height` to `0`:

```json
{ // only relevant parts are shown
  "MinGapLimit": 100,
  "BlockchainState": {
    "Network": "Main",
    "Height": "0"
  }
}
```

Save and then start Wasabi again, open the wallet and wait for the synchronization.
You should see all your transactions and the correct balance.

If you are recovering a wallet with the 12 recovery words, then in the advanced section you can increase the gap limit from a default of 100.
:::

:::details
### Why do I have to label my address?

Bitcoin addresses look like cyphertext, they are not easily remembered and it's not clear how they were used previously.
When you do not label all your addresses, there is no meta-data for you to understand the context of your coins.
Thus receiving addresses and sending transactions should be carefully labeled with the observers who know that this address belongs to you.
This helps you know where your coins came from so that you can judge whether there are privacy concerns when sending a specific coin to a specific receiver.

![Wasabi Wallet known by label](/ReceiveLabelingRequired.png "Wasabi Wallet known by label")

When labeling a newly generated address or a sending transaction you should ask yourself: "Who knows this address is mine?" or "Whom will I share this address with?" or "From whom am I receiving bitcoin?" or "To whom am I sending bitcoin?".
Labels should contain the comma-separated names of people/entities that may be aware of the transaction and could follow its trail like:

`Name of the sender or the receiver, name of the exchange, name of the payment processor`

So, a good label could be:

`Alice, <name of KYC exchange>, BTCPay Server`

or:

`Alice & Bob` (This is one entity which is not the same as `Alice, Bob` as they are multiple entities and thus separated by a comma)
:::

:::details
### How can I change the label of my receive address?

You can change the label of your unused receive address by clicking on the edit icon.
This is useful when you have generated a receiving address with a specific label, but then the cause for receiving has changed.
Take care with whom you have shared this address, because if you send it to several people, they might all send many coins to the same address.
This is very bad for your privacy because of [address reuse](/why-wasabi/AddressReuse.md), and it confuses you with the labeling of each unique coin.

![Edit Address Label](/UnusedReceiveAddressesEditLabel.png "Edit Address Label")
:::

:::details
### How can I edit the observers of my address after a transaction has gone through?

To date there is no possibility to change the label of an address after it has sent or received bitcoins.
:::

::::details
### Are there privacy concerns regarding whom I send my address?

Yes.
Whomever you send your address, he knows that this address, and any coin sent to it, belongs to you.
Thus it is important to have labeled receiving addresses with their observers, so that you know which address is known by whom.
It is important that you avoid sending the same address to several different individuals.
There is a risk that both of them send coins to this same destination, thus unnecessarily linking the payments.

:::danger
It is especially important to **NEVER** send your extended public key to any third party server.
This is a complete de-anonymization of your entire wallet!!
:::
::::

:::details
### Why does Wasabi only use SegWit bech32 addresses?

Wasabi was created after the activation of SegWit, and it makes sense to support the most advanced address type, which has numerous benefits.
For example, due to the malleability fix of SegWit, you can now remix CoinJoin outputs which are currently unconfirmed.
There are also large savings on mining fees for SegWit transactions.
:::

:::details
### Why do some third party services say the Wasabi address is invalid?

Some wallets/exchanges do not yet support native SegWit bech32 addresses and may give an error message (e.g. "unknown bitcoin address").
Please contact these services to upgrade their infrastructure to support the latest industry standards.
Wasabi cannot generate non-SegWit addresses, so one solution is to manage your funds with a wallet which does support legacy addresses.
To check Bech32 adoption and wallets/exchanges support you can follow the [Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32_adoption#Software_Wallets), [When Segwit](https://whensegwit.com/#who), and [Bitcoin Optech](https://bitcoinops.org/en/compatibility/#segwit-addresses).
:::

:::details
### Where can I find my address QR code?

When a new address is generated the QR code, address and label are displayed.
The QR code of an already generated address can be found at the `Unused Receive Addresses` list.
Click on the QR code icon at the Unused Receive Addresses.

![QR code icon](/UnusedReceiveAddressesQRCodeIcon.png "QR code icon")

The QR Code is displayed and can be saved as a png file by clicking on the Save icon, which appears on hover.

![Unused Receive Address](/UnusedReceiveAddress.png "Unused Receive Address")
:::

:::details
### What derivation paths does Wasabi use?

Wasabi follows [BIP 84: Derivation scheme for P2WPKH Based Accounts](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0084.mediawiki), so the main path is `m/84'/0'/0'`.
On TestNet and RegTest Wasabi uses `m/84'/0'/0'`, and not the standard `m/84'/1'/0'`.
Due to the CoinJoin implementation, the key depth can be rather large, thus when recovering the gap limit should be elevated to at least 100.
:::

:::details
### Can I generate a multi signature script?

No.

Multi signature scripts define that there need to be m-of-n signatures provided in order to spend this UTXO.
For example in a 2-of-3, Alice alone cannot spend the sats, she needs the collaboration of either Bob or Charlie.
In current implementations, a legacy and SegWit v0 multisig address is clearly distinguishable, there are three public keys and two signatures, and not one single public key and signature.
This means that your anonymity set, the crowd you hide in, gets a lot smaller.
If some one knows that you use a multisig wallet, then they can narrow down their search for your coins.
Thus, use of multisig decreases your privacy, and Wasabi is not implementing tools that degrade your privacy.

Yet multisig is a popular feature, and many Wasabikas do request it for extra security, willing to trade-off some privacy.
[Electrum Wallet](https://electrum.org) is a fantastic wallet with many features, but only private if you connect to your own Electrum server full node.
Electrum can be used to create different types of m-of-n multisig scripts, including the use of hardware wallets.

Schnorr key and signature aggregation with MuSig increases the privacy, since only one public key, not n, are committed on the blockchain.
So when Taproot is activated in the Bitcoin consensus layer, in #twoweeks, there are no privacy concerns standing in the way of Wasabi multisig!
:::

:::details
### How does Wasabi know of incoming transactions to the mempool?

When Wasabi is running, it connects to random Bitcoin peer to peer nodes and listens for their gossip of all transactions on the network.
Based on this information Wasabi builds its own local mempool of unconfirmed transactions.
So when you have Wasabi running, you will be notified about an incoming receiving transaction as soon as it is gossiped on the network.
But when Wasabi is offline, it does not listen to the network and it will not know about your unconfirmed transaction when you next launch Wasabi.
In this case you have to wait until your transaction is confirmed in a block, and based on the [BIP 158 block filters](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki), Wasabi will download that whole block including your transaction from a random P2P node.

:::details
### What are coins?

Bitcoin uses a system of [inputs and outputs](/why-wasabi/Coins.md) to keep track who owns how many sats.
Every transaction specifies one or more inputs, the chunk of bitcoin being spent, and one or more outputs, the destination of who receives the bitcoin.
A coin is also called an unspent transaction output (UTXO), meaning that this output has not been used as the input of a new transaction - it is yet to be spent.
In order to spend a UTXO, the valid signature and script has to be provided in the transaction.
This ensures that only with knowledge of the correct private key can this coin be sent to a new address.
This chain of links between inputs being spent and outputs being generated is verified by every full node, and stored on the blockchain.
:::

:::details
### Why is coin control so important?

Coin control is a feature in Wasabi that allows the user to choose which coins are to be spent as inputs in an outgoing transaction.
Coin control is aimed to avoid as much as possible transactions where privacy leaks are caused by amounts, change addresses, the transaction graph and the common-input-ownership heuristic.

Satoshis, the base currency in the Bitcoin network, are fungible units of account.
It's just a number that shows how much value is being transferred, and the number `100` is "the same" any time the number `100` is used.
The 9000 sats you spend on stickers are equal to the 9000 sats you spend on coffee.
Just like 1 gram of gold atoms are equal to any other 1 gram of gold atoms.

However, the unspent transaction outputs, the "coins" that hold the satoshi themselves are not fungible.
Every UTXO is a unique snowflake that has its own transaction history, as well as an independent spending condition.
The coin worth 2 bitcoin and locked by Alice's public key is not the same as the UTXO worth 5 bitcoin locked by the 2-of-3 multi signature of Bob, Charlie and David.
So when sending bitcoin, it's important to consider which actual outputs are being sent in the transaction.

It might be a problem when Alice sends the coin she received for a months worth of labor, in exchange for a coffee in Bob's store.
Now Bob knows the amount Alice gets paid, and this is none of his business.
Alice can protect herself against this by using a [CoinJoin](/using-wasabi/CoinJoin.md) UTXO, because now Bob cannot know the previous transactions from Alice.
:::

:::details
### How do I set a destination address?

In the `Send` tab, there is a text box for the `Address` right under the coin list.
If you have an address in the clipboard, then it is automatically pasted when you click on the box.
You can also type in the address manually, there is a checksum to help you identify typos.
Be careful and double-check the address, there is no way to revert this transaction and change the destination.
So make sure that the coins get into the right hands.

![Wasabi Wallet Send tab](/SendAmountFeePassword.png "Wasabi Wallet Send tab")
:::

:::details
### Can I pay to many addresses?

Unfortunately pay to many is not yet implemented in the GUI.
However, you can use the [RPC server `send` call](/using-wasabi/RPC.md#send) and specify multiple receiving addresses.
:::

:::details
### Can I set a custom change address?

No. That is currently not possible.
:::

:::details
### How do I set the payment amount?

After you select one or more coins as inputs in `Send` tab, say two anonset coins worth 0.1 bitcoin each.
You can manually set the exact amount that the destination address will receive in the output of the transaction, say 0.15 bitcoin.
Then Wasabi will help you with automatically calculating the precise change output value with `inputs - destination output - transaction fee`.

![Wasabi Wallet Send tab](/SendAmountFeePassword.png "Wasabi Wallet Send tab")
:::

:::details
### Why does Wasabi choose a new random node every time I send a transaction?

When you broadcast a transaction from a full node, that transaction is flooded onto the network.
Essentially, all nearby nodes are passed your transaction, and those nodes will pass to all of their nearby nodes, etc.
However, if a malicious adversary were to get enough relay nodes in the network, they could pretty easily connect the initial location of a transaction by simply observing from which node the transaction appeared first.
For this reason, broadcasting transaction through your own node may reveal your IP address.

So to fix this, Wasabi broadcasts your transaction to a random node over Tor, so this node cannot detect your IP address.
When you want to send another transaction, Wasabi destroys the original Tor circuit and establishes a new Tor identity and connection with a brand new node.
This reduces the risk of a passive bystander being able to link two transactions together that appear from the same location.
:::

::::details
### What fee should I select?

Wasabi uses the [smartfee](https://bitcointechtalk.com/an-introduction-to-bitcoin-core-fee-estimation-27920880ad0) estimation algorithm provided by bitcoind.
This integrates both data from recent blocks, as well as the local mempool to estimate the current and future demand for blockspace.
The lower the fee is, the longer the estimated wait; and the higher the fee, the faster the confirmation will come.
There are several different confidence levels, each of them gives an educated guess how soon the transaction will confirm.
But the provided time frames are only a rough estimation, and not at all a precise metric.

![Wasabi Wallet mining fee settings](/SendFeeSlider.png "Wasabi Wallet mining fee settings")

Because confirmation fee estimation is more an art than a science, you can also set the fee manually.
Then you can go after your gut feeling, [mempool chart analysis](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,24h), or just putting the minimum of 1 sat/vByte.

For a transaction to yourself, for example from your hot coinjoin wallet to your hardware wallet, you don't need to have fast confirmation, so you can set a relatively low fee.
But to send from the hot coinjoin wallet to the coffee shop, you might want to get faster confirmation, thus paying a higher fee.
This really depends on your own time preference in every unique moment.

:::tip Remember
These sats are precious, so don't overpay on fees!
:::
::::

:::details
### How do I set custom fee rate?

At the `Preview Transaction` dialog, click on the icon `Change transaction fee or confirmation time`.
At the transaction fee slider dialog, click on `Advanced` and manually type the fee rate (sat/vByte) you want.

![Wasabi Wallet custom fee rate](/SendCustomFee.png "Wasabi Wallet custom fee rate")
:::

:::details
### How do I select coins for spending?

Unlike other Bitcoin wallets, the user cannot spend from Wasabi without selecting coins, since ["Coin Control Is Must Learn If You Care About Your Privacy In Bitcoin"](https://medium.com/@nopara73/coin-control-is-must-learn-if-you-care-about-your-privacy-in-bitcoin-33b9a5f224a2), at least for today.
In order to spend some coins, simply select them by clicking their checkboxes from the list.
Wasabi will automatically build a transaction with the best combination of the selected coins.

![Wasabi Wallet Send tab](/Send.png "Wasabi Wallet Send tab")
:::

:::details
### How is the transaction broadcast?

Wasabi connects only to Bitcoin nodes that provide a Tor onion service, so end-to-end encryption is enforced between the peers, without involving any exit node.
Each peer is connected to through a different Tor stream.
Transactions are broadcast to only one random peer over Tor and immediately after that this peer is disconnected.

If for some reason this fails, and a local [Bitcoin full node](/using-wasabi/BitcoinFullNode.md) is connected, then this is used to broadcast the transaction.
By default it is gossiped to 8 peers over clearnet, but this depends on how the full node is configured by the user.

If this too fails, Wasabi will (in the last resort) send the transaction through a new Tor identity to the coordinator backend for broadcasting.

Once a transaction is sent, Wasabi will always open a new Tor circuit with a new random node on the network, in order to avoid giving away too much information to one party.
When you send two consecutive transactions via Wasabi, you can be sure that they appear in two very different places on the network.

Wasabi might implement [BIP 156](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0156.mediawiki) the Dandelion protocol for transaction broadcasting when the Bitcoin network adopts it.
:::

:::details
### What is the cluster history?

Clusters are a property of a Bitcoin wallet with strong coin-control and good labeling.
When you use Wasabi, you must label every coin that you receive with the observers.
The reason why this is important, is that your "wallet" is really just a collection of coins (similar to a physical wallet, not to a bank account).
When you receive coins from somewhere to a labeled address, Wasabi will store the label locally on your device, for example:

`----> 0.65 BTC (Bob)`

Now if you receive money from Alice who uses an exchange, then your label would look like this:

`----> 2.1 BTC (Alice, exchange)`

Now here is where things can be a bit tricky for folks unfamiliar with Bitcoin.
Suppose you wanted to send all of your coins to a hardware wallet.
So you think to yourself "What's the harm in sending my money to one address?"

This is how the transaction will look like:

```
0.65 BTC (Bob)           ----->  2.75 BTC (Bob, Alice, exchange)
2.1 BTC (Alice, exchange)
```

The problem with this transaction, is Bob knows you, and knows that the 0.65 BTC is in your possession, and can monitor your transaction behavior.
But when you combine (consolidate) your coins in this way, you reveal to Bob that you also have 2.1 BTC from somewhere else, and you reveal to the exchange that you have 0.65 bitcoin from somewhere else.

When you [CoinJoin](/using-wasabi/CoinJoin.md) coins with Wasabi, you actually de-link the trail from Bob/exchange, to the coins in your wallet.
The coin will have an anonymity set > 1, and typically will have a <img src="/ShieldGreen.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet green shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet green shield anonymity set" class="shield" /> shield.
This coin can now be spent without having to worry about your boss or the exchange tracking your behavior.

However, when you mix a coin, there is often change.
This change is marked <img src="/ShieldRed.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet red shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet red shield anonymity set" class="shield" /> and has an anonymity set = 1 (with a couple of small exceptions regarding remixing).
The change is completely linked to your coins before the mix, and so needs to be dealt with properly.
If you combine the tiny bit of change you received from Bob and from the exchange, they still know how much money you had (but not where you are spending it).

So the idea around clusters is to make it easier for users to follow the transaction graph.
The transaction graph is the history of where a coin has been, and is important if different histories need to be separated.
For example, if you buy coins anonymously in a P2P way, you should try to avoid mixing those coins with coins you got in a public way (donation, exchange, etc.).

### What's the difference between Send and Build Transaction?

The only difference is that `Build Transaction` does not propagate the transaction, it simply builds it.
For a hot Wasabi with private keys, it will build and sign a final transaction, that can be broadcasted at any time.
For a cold Wasabi with private keys on a hardware wallet, it will build an unsigned transaction, which must be signed offline on the hardware wallet before it is valid.
:::

:::details
### Why Wasabi did not send some of my selected coins?

Because they were not necessary for the transaction.
Wasabi Wallet will use only the necessary coins to make the transaction.

Example: If you select 10 coins with total value of 2 btc and you want to send 1 btc but the sum of 4 coins is enough to make the transaction, then Wasabi will use only those 4 coins.

This is good for privacy, and also saves you some transaction fees.
:::

:::details
### How can I bump the transaction fee with child pays for parent (CPFP)?

If you have sent or received a transaction with a low fee and it does not get confirmed within reasonable time, then you can do child pays for parent to get it confirmed faster.
The trick is, to make a new transaction which spends the unconfirmed coin that you have received with a higher fee.
This can be either a payment transaction from you to another person, or a self spend transaction.

The transaction will get confirmed based on the fee level of the combined parent and child transactions.
For example, if the initial transaction pays a 1 sat/vbyte fee and the child transaction pays a 5 sat/vbyte fee, then the combined fee level is the average of both, thus 3 sat/vbyte.
(Assuming both transactions are roughly the same size.)
:::

:::details
### Why is there no `Send` button, only the `Receive` button is displayed?

When the wallet has a balance of 0.00000000 BTC, the `Send` button is hidden because there is no bitcoin to send.
So this happens when a new wallet has just been generated and it hasn't received any bitcoin yet.
Receive some bitcoin and then the `Send` button will automatically be displayed.

There is also no `Send` button with watch-only wallets.
:::

:::details
### Can I send (privately) from my wallet when the privacy progress is below 100%?

Yes, you can always send from your wallet.
However, a best practice is to only send private funds.
Making your wallet 100% private [takes some time](FAQ-UseWasabi.md#how-long-does-it-take-to-make-my-wallet-100%-private), but in the mean time you can always send the (private) funds.

So when your wallet is partially private (between 0 and 100% privacy progress) it is a best practice to only use the private available funds, to protect your privacy.
In the privacy progress tile, `PRIVATE` shows the currently available private BTC amount.
So that is the amount (minus the mining fees) which can be sent privately, even if the privacy progress is not yet 100%.
When sending, the wallet automatically selects the private funds first.

For example:

When `PRIVATE` is 0.00787086 BTC, that means that I can send less than that privately.
Even when the `Privacy Progress` is below 100%.
So when sending, less than 0.00787086 BTC (to cover the mining fees) should be entered as the `Amount` in order to only use the private funds.

### What's the legal status of Wasabi/CoinJoin?

USA: On May 9, 2019, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued an interpretive guidance that stated the following in section 4.5.1(b):
> An anonymizing software provider is not a money transmitter. FinCEN regulations exempt from the definition of money transmitter those persons providing "the delivery, communication, or network access services used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services."

Wasabi is an Anonymizing software provider so it is not a money transmitter, thus not under Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulations.
Basically we can continue to operate like now and [it is compliant](/why-wasabi/LegalConcern.md).

Here's a great explanation about it:

:::details
### What is the minimum amount required to coinjoin?

The minimum amount of bitcoin per coinjoin round is 0.00005000 BTC (5000 sats) + mining fees.
:::

:::details
### What is the maximum amount I can coinjoin?

The maximum possible amount is 1343.75 BTC per coin per coinjoin round.
If the user has a coin of more than 1343.75 BTC, then it must be broken down into smaller parts to be able to coinjoin.
:::

:::details
### What are the fees for the coinjoin?

Coinjoin fees are composed of coordination fees and mining (network) fees.
Coins (UTXOs) with a value above 0.01 BTC pay 0.3% as a coordination fee + mining fees.
Coins of 0.01 BTC or below don't pay coordination fees.
Remixes, even after one transaction, also don't pay coordination fees. 
Thus, a payment made with coinjoined funds allows the sender and the recipient to remix their coins without paying any coordination fees.

|  | > 0.01 BTC | 0.01 BTC and less |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Fresh input | 0.3% coordination fee + mining fees  | mining fees |
| Remix* | mining fees | mining fees |

*Remix includes a 1 hop transaction
:::

:::details
### What is the anonymity set?

The anonymity set is effectively the size of the group you are hiding in.

If 3 people take part in a CoinJoin (with equal size inputs) and there are 3 outputs then each of those output coins has an anonymity set of 3.

```
0.1 BTC (Alice)       0.1 BTC (Anon set 3)
0.3 BTC (Bob)     ->  0.1 BTC (Anon set 3)
0.4 BTC (Charlie)     0.1 BTC (Anon set 3)
                      0.2 BTC (Change Coin Bob)
                      0.3 BTC (Change Coin Charlie)
```

There is no way to know which of the anon set output coins are owned by which of the input owners.

All an observer knows is that a specific anon set output coin is owned by one of the owners of one of the input coins, that is 3 people - hence an anonymity set of 3.

Your Wasabi software has limited information on what the actually achieved anonymity set is, so the anonymity set that the software presents you is just an estimation, not an accurate value.
With Wasabi we are trying to do lower estimations, rather than higher ones.

### What are the equal denominations created in a coinjoin round?

The standard denominations are:
`5000`, `6561`, `8192`, `10000`, `13122`, `16384`, `19683`, `20000`, `32768`, `39366`, `50000`, `59049`, `65536`, `100000`, `118098`, `131072`, `177147`, `200000`, `262144`, `354294`, `500000`, `524288`, `531441`, `1000000`, `1048576`, `1062882`, `1594323`, `2000000`, `2097152`, `3188646`, `4194304`, `4782969`, `5000000`, `8388608`, `9565938`, `10000000`, `14348907`, `16777216`, `20000000`, `28697814`, `33554432`, `43046721`, `50000000`, `67108864`, `86093442`, `100000000`, `129140163`, `134217728`, `200000000`, `258280326`, `268435456`, `387420489`, `500000000`, `536870912`, `774840978`, `1000000000`, `1073741824`, `1162261467`, `2000000000`, `2147483648`, `2324522934`, `3486784401`, `4294967296`, `5000000000`, `6973568802`, `8589934592`, `10000000000`, `10460353203`, `17179869184`, `20000000000`, `20920706406`, `31381059609`, `34359738368`, `50000000000`, `62762119218`, `68719476736`, `94143178827`, `100000000000`, `137438953472` sats.

So, there are 79 denominations from 0.00005000 BTC up to 1374.38953472 BTC.

:::details
### What is happening in the input registration phase?

During this phase you have the opportunity to register coins that you want to mix in this round.
Your Wasabi client connects to the coordinator server with a unique Tor identity called Alice, and with it you send the input proofs, the cleartext change output, and the blinded anonset CoinJoin address.
When all the proofs are valid, the coordinator signs the blinded output without knowing which address this is, and sends this back to Alice.
Since the goal is to have 100 peers in one round, the [input registration phase](/using-wasabi/CoinJoin.md#input-registration) can take some time.
But regardless of how many participants, one hour after the last CoinJoin this phase is complete.
:::

:::details
### What is happening in the connection confirmation phase?

Because the input registration phase can take up to one hour, the coordinator needs to ensure that everyone is still online and ready to continue.
So in the [connection confirmation phase](/using-wasabi/CoinJoin.md#connection-confirmation) every Alice sends a signal to the coordinator, and when all have checked in, this phase concludes.
:::

:::details
### What is happening in the output registration phase?

You use some secret parameters to unblind the blinded CoinJoin output to reveal the cleartext address that still contains the signature of the coordinator.
Wasabi creates a new Tor identity called Bob, and with it you send the unblinded anonset output together with the signature to the coordinator.
The coordinator can now verify his own signature, thus he knows that previously he has confirmed that Alice had all valid inputs.
Immediately after that, Bob disconnects and the [output registration phase](/using-wasabi/CoinJoin.md#output-registration) is complete.
:::

:::details
### What is happening in the signing phase?

After all Alices have registered their inputs and change outputs, and all Bobs their anonset outputs, the coordinator has all the information to build the CoinJoin transaction and include his fee output.
This raw transaction is sent to all Alices, each of them verifies the transaction is valid and then signs it.
The signature is sent back to the coordinator who accumulates all of them and builds the signed final CoinJoin transaction.
The [singing phase](/using-wasabi/CoinJoin.md#signing) is concluded when the coordinator receives all the signatures.
:::

:::details
### What is happening in the broadcasting phase?

In the [broadcasting phase](/using-wasabi/CoinJoin.md#broadcasting) the coordinator sends the signed final CoinJoin transaction to several random Bitcoin peer to peer nodes, and it is gossiped throughout the network to the miners.
:::

:::details
### Is there any additional anonymity using multiple wallets for CoinJoins?

You'd gain 1 less anonymity set than if you'd only mix with one wallet (and Wasabi doesn't display that).
On the other hand, the systemic anonymity is slightly improved if a few people are mixing with multiple wallets, because that removes the certainty on this Blockchain analysis assumption.
:::

:::details
### How is the anonymity set target determined for CoinJoins?

`2*2 = 4` and `3*3 = 9`. `2->3: 50% increase`, `4->9:125%` increase.
So remixing with larger anonsets is exponentially more effective than smaller anonsets.
Regarding why do we want 100 number, is among some other reasons, because that was our calculation to be that would make rounds happen in every 2-5 minutes, considering the liquidity of some custodial mixers.
Regarding DoS attack, right now our DoS configuration is set to be pretty permissive and this seems to be sufficient for the time being.
If a DoS attack would happen, Wasabi team would just harden it in the config file and would kick the bad actors out.
Now if even that would fail, then we can start thinking about lowering the required peers and also other methods.
:::

:::details
### I'd like to experience coinjoin but I'm not comfortable using real Bitcoin. What can I do?

You can try to make a coinjoin via Wasabi on the Bitcoin [TestNet](/using-wasabi/Testnet.md) (an alternative Bitcoin network, to be used for testing).
Go to `Settings` > `Bitcoin` and change the network to `TestNet`.
Then restart your Wasabi and create a new wallet, this is needed because Wasabi differentiates between "Main wallets" and "TestNet wallets".
This wallet will synchronize for the TestNet, and generate TestNet addresses.
You can get tBTC from faucets like:
[testnet-faucet.mempool.co](https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/)
or
[coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/)
:::

:::details
### Does Wasabi have to stay on during CoinJoin?

Yes, Wasabi needs to stay on during CoinJoins, you cannot be offline and still participate in CoinJoins.

A CoinJoin transaction is different from a normal transaction, where you are the only person signing, and requires many people to sign the same transaction.

Here is how Wasabi handles different scenarios:

|  | During [input registration phase](FAQ-UseWasabi.md#what-is-happening-in-the-input-registration-phase) | After input registration phase |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| You close Wasabi | Your registered coins are automatically dequeued | Wasabi will make you wait until the round finishes |
| Wasabi goes offline | Your registered coins are automatically timed out by the coordinator after 1 minute | Your registered coins will be banned for 24h from participating in another CoinJoin. (This is to prevent [DoS attacks](https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink/#d-dos-attack)) |
:::

:::details
### What if there's a power outage during CoinJoin? Do I lose my coins?

No you don't.
CoinJoins are atomic, they either happen or they don't.
If your wallet crashes or your computer goes offline during CoinJoin you simply don't participate in this CoinJoin, look at table [here](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.md#does-wasabi-have-to-stay-on-during-coinjoin) for more info.
:::

:::details
### How much anonymity set do I need?

The amount of privacy needed depends on your individual threat model, who is trying to deanonymize you?
It is commonly said that an anonymity set of 50 is sufficient to evade low-level blockchain forensics analysis, but it might not protect you against large adversaries.
At least one round to re-mix your coins can increase your privacy drastically.
With Wasabi this can be achieved in a matter of hours (or minutes if there are a lot of users).
:::

:::details
### How does my wallet communicate with the Wasabi coordinator server?

Wasabi communicates in many ways to the coordinator server, and it is always over the Tor network.

First of all, Wasabi uses [BIP 158 block filters](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki) to ensure network level privacy.
You can follow these FAQs to have a full explanation on the theme:
- [What are BIP-158 Block Filters?](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.md#what-are-bip-158-block-filters)
- [What software supplies the block filters that Wasabi uses?](/FAQ/FAQ-Introduction.md#what-software-supplies-the-block-filters-that-wasabi-uses)
- [Can the coordinator attack me?](/FAQ/FAQ-Introduction.md#can-the-coordinator-attack-me)
- [Is the backend's coordinator code open-source?](/FAQ/FAQ-Introduction.md#is-the-backend-s-coordinator-code-open-source)

Then, there are five different phases in a CoinJoin.
You can follow these links to have a full explanation on that:
1. [Input registration phase](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.md#what-is-happening-in-the-input-registration-phase)
2. [Connection confirmation phase](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.md#what-is-happening-in-the-connection-confirmation-phase)
3. [Output registration phase](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.md#what-is-happening-in-the-output-registration-phase)
4. [Signing phase](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.md#what-is-happening-in-the-signing-phase)
5. [Broadcasting phase](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.md#what-is-happening-in-the-broadcasting-phase)

The backend server also sends you information about the current mempool for fee estimation as well as the US Dollar exchange rate.
:::

:::details
### How long does it take to mix my coins?

It depends on many things, the longest period is the wait for all peers to register their coins.
Every round has a goal of 100 anonymity set.
Wasabi is developed in a way that there's a round at least once every one hour.
If the 100 peers registered earlier, then there can be many rounds per hour.
When all peers are registered, then the signing phase is done within a couple of seconds.

Summing up: the faster peers register in the CoinJoins, the faster the mixes are.
:::

:::details
### What is the address of the coordinator?

The coordinator possibly gets paid in every coinjoin.
Wasabi is using a fresh unused coordinator address for every coinjoin round.
:::

:::details
### What is the maximum number of coins that can be registered in a coinjoin?

Wasabi Wallet's default client is configured to register a maximum of 10 inputs per round.
However, as the coordinator cannot enforce this, a custom client could use a different configuration.
:::

:::details
### How many coins/outputs do I get from a coinjoin?

Wasabi Wallet's default client is configured to register 1 up to 8 outputs per coinjoin round.
However, as the coordinator cannot enforce this, a custom client could use a different configuration.
:::

:::details
### How long does it take to make my wallet 100% private?

Depending on many factors, like the `Anonymity score target`, the `coinjoin strategy`, and the amount of bitcoin, it can take from a couple hours to multiple days.
:::

:::details
### What does the `Auto-start coinjoin threshold` mean in the coinjoin settings?

It is the amount at which your funds will automatically participate in coinjoin in the background.
If the non-private wallet balance is less than this amount coinjoin will not automatically start.
A use case is that it might not be economical to coinjoin with this non-private amount (fee amount compared to coinjoin amount).

For example, if the non-private balance is 0.005 BTC and the `Auto-start coinjoin threshold` is 0.01 BTC, the user will have to manually press Play to start coinjoining.
The default Auto-start coinjoin threshold is 0.01 BTC.

![Auto-start coinjoin threshold](/AutoStartCoinjoinThreshold.png "Auto-start coinjoin threshold")
:::

:::details
### What does the `Red coin isolation` mean in the coinjoin settings?

When the `Red coin isolation` is active, only a single coin with anonymity score 1 will be allowed into the coinjoin registration.
To prevent possible coinjoin input heuristics from outside observers.
The `Red coin isolation` is active by default when the `Maximize Privacy` profile is selected.

## Backup and Recovery

::::details
### How do I back up my mnemonic words?

:::tip
Write down your recovery words!
:::

Wasabi uses [BIP 39: mnemonic code for generating deterministic keys](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) to enable easy backups of all private keys in the wallet.
The mnemonic is displayed as 12 recovery words that are only shown once during the wallet generation.

![Wasabi Wallet recovery words](/AddWalletRecoveryWords.png "Wasabi Wallet recovery words")

:::danger
In order to restore a wallet, you need BOTH the recovery words AND the password!
:::

It is a good idea to keep the two in separate analog backups, such as a laminated paper written with pencil.
In order to defend against nature destroying fragile paper, you can consider stamping the words into metal.
Use two different backups and locations for the mnemonic and password, because whoever has both [including a physical attacker] has full access to your sats.
Find a secure physical location to store the backups, maybe a home safe, or an expert security deposit box.

Please see [Backup Best Practices](/using-wasabi/BackupBestPractices.md) for more information about backups.
::::

::::details
### How do I back up my wallet file?

Although you can back up your private keys with the mnemonic words and password, this is only a last resort recovery.
If you want to also secure your address labels, the anonscore and additional metadata, then you can do a digital backup.
Simply copy the `WalletBackups` folder with the `wallet.json` files from your [Wasabi data folder](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.md#where-can-i-find-the-wasabi-data-folder) onto suitable hardware, for example an encrypted USB stick.
Note that this file has the encrypted private key (extracted from the extended private key), meaning that you only need the password to spend the bitcoin.
This also contains the extended public key, the public keys, and the address labels, meaning that it completely links all the coins, both pre and post mix, with clear proof.

:::warning
Make sure to back up your password separately because it is necessary to spend your bitcoin.
:::

:::tip
The wallet file backup is sensitive, in terms of privacy, but not critical in terms of loss of funds (if a password was used when generating the wallet).
So it is good advice to encrypt this wallet file.
:::
::::

:::details
### Can I recover my wallet without the password?

No.
The password you set is used as a 13th word (passphrase) as described in BIP39, you should back it up when you generate a wallet.
It is necessary to spend your bitcoin or to recover your wallet.
:::

:::details
### What should I do if I forget my password?

Try to use the [Password Finder Tool](/using-wasabi/PasswordFinder.md) to find your password.
Having a close guess of what the password is increases the possibility that you get your password.
:::

:::details
### I lost the recovery words but I still have the .json file and the password. Is my wallet still recoverable?

Yes, but in this case it is advisable to create a new wallet and back up the new recovery words and the password, then move your bitcoin there.

The .json file contains the encrypted secret that requires the password to derive your private keys.
That gives you access to your bitcoin.
:::

:::details
### Can I verify the Recovery Words of an existing wallet?

Yes.
Go to `Wallet Settings` > `Verify Recovery Words`.
Type in your recovery words in the correct order, click on `Verify` and it will show you if they are correct or not.

### What hardware wallets does Wasabi support?

Wasabi uses the Bitcoin Core [Hardware Wallet Interface (HWI)](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI) which allows it to support a variety of hardware wallets.
For the complete list of all the officially supported hardware wallets, click [here](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/WasabiCompatibility.md#officially-supported-hardware-wallets).
::::

:::details
### Why does Wasabi use the Hardware Wallet Interface?

Wasabi uses the [Bitcoin Core Hardware Wallet Interface [HWI]](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI), a python library tool for proper integration of off-line signing devices.
It provides a standard way for any software wallet to communicate with any hardware wallet without needing any device specific drivers.
HWI was developed and carefully reviewed over several years, with outstanding contributions by [Andrew Chow](https://github.com/achow101).
Wasabi implements C# code that executes the HWI tool.
Wasabi uses this powerful tool because there are no other dependencies necessary to support all the existing and future hardware wallets.
:::

:::details
### Does Wasabi support the hidden wallets of hardware wallets?

Partially.
Only device side passphrase is supported.
PC side passphrase is not.
This means that the hidden wallet feature can be used with Trezor T, Ledger Nano S, Nano S Plus, Nano X and ColdCard.
After the 12 or 24 words, enter the passphrase as the 13th or 25th word on the hardware wallet.
It’s part of [BIP 39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).

Verify the address and amount and the ColdCard will then create a signed.psbt and final.txn file on the MicroSD card.
The finalized transaction (`xxx-final.txn`) can now be broadcast by Wasabi Wallet with the `Broadcast Transaction` tool, or even a radio or satellite dish if someone is listening!

### How can I import and broadcast a final transaction from ColdCard?

In the top menu bar, go to `Tools > Broadcast Transaction` and in this tab click `Import Transaction`, now you can select the previously finalized (and signed) transaction file from the MicroSD card.
If this fails you can manually type the path to this file in Wasabi Wallet to load the transaction.
Now click `Broadcast Transaction` to send it off over Tor to a random Bitcoin node so it can flood over to the miners for confirmation in a block.

### Can I coinjoin bitcoins on my hardware wallet?

No, that is currently not possible.
A coinjoin is a multi round interactive process, and requires fast signing by the participants, thus the keys need to be on a hot computer.
Thus currently you have to send the bitcoins from your hardware wallet to a `hot` Wasabi Wallet, do the coinjoin and then send them back to a new address on the Hardware wallet for cold-storage.

### Does Ledger Live send my public keys and addresses to a third party server?

Only if you add your accounts in the app, but not if you update your device firmware or install apps.
When using the Ledger Live software wallet to manage your coins, you send all of your used, and 20 unused addresses to Ledger's nodes. [Source](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010892360)

Your extended public key, however, is not shared with Ledger's node, but rather stored encrypted on your local machine.
Read more [here](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011069619).

Ledger could potentially analyze information from API calls to their nodes to link addresses to individual users, though Ledger says no logs are kept during normal operation.

To avoid any privacy leak, you can use a Ledger hardware wallet in combination with Wasabi as a software interface, and because Wasabi does not leak your addresses, your transaction history is not shared with anyone.

### After I CoinJoined my coins and reached green anonset, I sent them to my hardware wallet address. When I check my HW via Wasabi, the coins are now red. Why?

Everything is working as expected.

The anonymity set info (number) is tied to your wallet that you used to CoinJoin, if you send a mixed coin to another Wasabi Wallet of yours (hardware wallet or normal wallet) it will have an anonymity set 1 <img src="/ShieldRed.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet red shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet red shield anonymity set" class="shield" /> because this wallet doesn't know that the coin was coinjoined.

You should put a meaningful label when you generate a receive address in your hardware wallet, e.g. "coinjoined utxo with anonymity set 70" (something that reminds you that you got this utxo from your Wasabi Wallet and it was coinjoined).

### How can I use Hardware Wallets on Linux (udev rules)?

On Linux, you need to create a set of `udev rules` for the hardware wallet to be reachable.

Udev rules instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/blob/master/hwilib/udev/README.md).

## History

:::details
### How can I check the transactions history?

The wallet's main page displays the history of all transactions made with this specific wallet.
It includes receiving, sending, and coinjoin transactions.

:::details
### How can I see coinjoins in the history list?

Coinjoin transactions are indicated with a shield icon:

![History Coinjoin](/HistoryCoinjoin.png "History Coinjoin")

When the wallet has made multiple coinjoins, the coinjoins will be clustered.
To see the individual coinjoins, the cluster can be expanded by clicking the arrow on the left:

![History Coinjoin Expanded](/HistoryCoinjoinExpanded.png "History Coinjoin Expanded")

A coinjoin is a payment within the same wallet, thus it only shows the coordination and mining fee leaving the wallet.

### Can I sort the history items?

Yes, the history items can be sorted by clicking on the column title:

### Can I export a list of transactions?

There is currently no convenient way to export a list with transaction details inside the GUI.
However, you can see the `wallet.json` files inside the `WalletBackups` folder (you can find it in your [Wasabi data folder](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.md#where-can-i-find-the-wasabi-data-folder)) which contains all the public keys, labels and anonset.

You can use the [Wasabi RPC server `gethistory` call](/using-wasabi/RPC.md#gethistory) to get a list of all transactions, including date, block height, amount, label and tx id.

### How do I connect my own full node to Wasabi?

There are three different ways of using your [Bitcoin full node with Wasabi](/using-wasabi/BitcoinFullNode.md):

- If you have a full node already running on the same computer as Wasabi, it will automatically be detected and used by default.
- If you have a full node on a remote computer, then you can connect to it by specifying the local network IP address or Tor onion service in the Wasabi `Settings` tab.

![Wasabi Wallet Remote P2P Bitcoin Endpoint full node](/SettingsBitcoinCoreRemote.png "Wasabi Wallet Remote P2P Bitcoin Endpoint full node")

- If you are not yet running a full node, Wasabi has the bitcoind binaries included, and with one click in the `Settings`, you can start Bitcoin Knots together with Wasabi.

### How can I turn off Tor?

You can turn off `Network anonymization (Tor)` in the Settings.
Note that this is a privacy concern, especially when you coinjoin and when you broadcast a transaction.
In the first case, the coordinator would know the links between your inputs and outputs based on your IP address.
In the second case, if you happen to broadcast a transaction of yours to a full node that is spying on you, it will know the link between your transaction and your IP address.

:::danger
It is recommended to always use Tor!
The setting to turn it off is only intended for debugging and trouble shooting.

### How can I change the anonymity score target?
 
The anonscore target is a wallet specific setting which is determined by the `Coinjoin Strategy`, but can also be manually changed in the `Coinjoin Settings` dialog.

On the main view click the three dots on the top right corner after loading the wallet.
Choose `Coinjoin Settings`, click `Change` (Coinjoin strategy), click `Customize`.
Move the `Anonymity score target` slider to the desired value and click `Done`.

![Coinjoin Settings Anonymity score target](/AnonymityScoreTarget.png "Coinjoin Settings Anonymity score target")

Alternatively, you can change the anonymity score target by editing the wallet file.
Go to the SearchBar and click `Wallet Folder` and open the wallet json file and edit the `AnonScoreTarget` value.

### What is the dust threshold?

Dust can mean [a lot of things](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/10986/what-is-meant-by-bitcoin-dust), depending on how you look at it.
It can be a non-economical input, that is a UTXO that has less value than the fees it would cost to spend this coin.
A dust attack is actually about [forced address reuse](https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy#Forced_address_reuse), the malicious actor sends very small amounts into old addresses and consolidation of these dust UTXOs can link several coins in a wallet cluster.

Specifically in the context of Wasabi, with the dust threshold settings you can limit the value of coins shown in the GUI.
Coins that you receive from other wallets which are *less than or equal to* the dust threshold in value are not shown.
For example: When you set it to `0.0000 5000 BTC`, and when you receive a coin worth `0.0000 4000 BTC`, then this transaction and the coin in the coin list will not be shown.

### How can I change to the white theme?

You can change from the default dark to the white theme by disabling `Dark Mode` in the Settings.
Alternatively, you can switch to `Dark Mode` in the `.walletwasabi/client/UIConfig.json` [data folder](/FAQ/FAQ-UseWasabi.md#where-can-i-find-the-wasabi-data-folder).
Open the `UIConfig.json` file and change the line from `"DarkModeEnabled": true` to `"DarkModeEnabled": false`.
Save the file and restart Wasabi.
Please note that Wasabi is designed for the dark theme, and some color schemes might not look beautiful in the white mode.

### Can I consolidate anonset coins?

It is advisable to limit the recombining of <img src="/ShieldCheckmark.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet green checkmark shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet green checkmark shield anonymity set" class="shield" /> <img src="/ShieldGreen.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet green shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet green shield anonymity set" class="shield" /> <img src="/ShieldYellow.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet yellow shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet yellow shield anonymity set" class="shield" /> mixed coins because it can only decrease the privacy of these coins.
This reveals that all the consolidated UTXOs are controlled by one entity, which was not known before the consolidation.
That said, if you combine only a couple of mixed coins, you might not reveal your pre-CoinJoin transaction history, especially when you did several re-mixes.

:::warning Take great care!
Never consolidate <img src="/ShieldRed.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet red shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet red shield anonymity set" class="shield" /> unmixed coins with <img src="/ShieldCheckmark.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet green checkmark shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet green checkmark shield anonymity set" class="shield" /> <img src="/ShieldGreen.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet green shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet green shield anonymity set" class="shield" /> <img src="/ShieldYellow.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet yellow shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet yellow shield anonymity set" class="shield" /> mixed coins, as this negates the privacy benefits of the CoinJoin.

### How can I send my anonset coins to my hardware wallet?

Most hardware wallets communicate with servers to provide you with your balance.
This reveals your public key to the server, which damages your privacy - the hardware wallet company can now link together all your addresses.
As a result **it is not recommended** that you send your mixed coins to an address associated with your hardware wallet unless you are confident that you have set up your hardware wallet in a way that it does not communicate with a 3rd party server (see below).

You can, however, manage your hardware wallet with the Wasabi interface.
Alternatively, you can use your hardware wallet with Electrum, and in order to not leak any information to thir-party servers run your own [Electrum Personal Server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server), [ElectrumX](https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx) or [Electrs](https://github.com/romanz/electrs).

### What can I do with small change?

There are no hard and fast rules for [what to do with the change](/using-wasabi/ChangeCoins.md).
Generally try to avoid the change and use the `Max` button extensively to send whole coins.
The most problematic type of change is what has `anonymity set 1` <img src="/ShieldRed.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet red shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet red shield anonymity set" class="shield" />.
You should treat it as a kind of toxic waste [handled with great care].
You can spend the change to the same entity as the initial transaction, without loosing any privacy.
Only spend the change to another entity, if these two won't make you trouble knowing you interact with both of them.
If needed, you can consolidate several change coins, but we advise you to do it in a CoinJoin.
In JoinMarket you can specify the exact amount of CoinJoin, so it can be exactly the amount of the change.
Or open a new Lightning Network node (not your main Lightning node), create a channel to a random peer on the network and route the funds back to you.

### Why do my coins occasionally get banned from participating in CoinJoin?

A CoinJoin consists of multiple users registering inputs (coins) and blinded outputs.
Once the appropriate number of participants have registered, the actual transaction (the CoinJoin) is constructed by the coordinator, and given to all participants in the span of about 60 seconds.
At this point, all registered participants must sign off on the CoinJoin, and if a single one of the participants fails to sign their input, the entire CoinJoin must be restarted.

So this introduces a problem, or an attack vector - a malicious user could purposefully register coins, only to wait for the signing phase and not sign.
This would halt the entire CoinJoin process for all other participants and Wasabi would no longer work.
This is also known as [denial of service attack](https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink/#d-dos-attack).

So a simple solution looks like this - the coordinator could collect signatures from all inputs, and if one or more input refuses to sign, the coordinator could record that input and temporarily (or even permanently) ban that coin from participation.
This is a nice solution, as it mitigates a single coin from ruining all CoinJoins, but it too comes with trade-offs.

For example, most of the time, users fail to sign a CoinJoin for non-malicious reasons.
Perhaps their Tor connection went down in precisely that moment, or perhaps their WiFi had a temporary flicker at the wrong time.
Further, some users don't even realize that the signing phase is happening, and sometimes shut down their computer at exactly the wrong moment.
All of these things hinder a successful CoinJoin for all other participants, but by pure accident.

If you are one of the victims of this temporary banning then simply wait for the ban to expire and try again.
The best thing you can do to avoid the issue is to have a strong internet connection and keep your computer online throughout the whole process.

:::tip Note:
Banning does not mean freezing.
You can send banned coins to anyone you want.
This is a temporary ban on your coins in participation of the CoinJoin.

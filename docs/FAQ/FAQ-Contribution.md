# Contributions to Wasabi

## Donations

### Why should I donate?

Wasabi is Free Open Source Software (FOSS), which means it doesn't generate revenue.
However, maintaining and improving the software requires ongoing effort: regular updates are necessary to ensure safety, fix bugs, and continue innovating.

While Wasabi is one of the best tools available to use Bitcoin privately, achieving flawless financial-sovereign privacy is still a work in progress.
There are many features yet to be implemented, and your support can help make them a reality.

Additionally, contributors cover static costs, such as server expenses and release management, using their personal funds.

By donating, youâ€™re directly supporting the developers who work tirelessly to maintain and improve Wasabi Wallet and make Bitcoin privacy accessible for everyone.


### How I can donate?

You can support The Wasabi Wallet Developers by:

- Clicking the `Donate` button in Wasabi (version > 2.4.0)
- Sending funds to their Silent Payment address: `sp1qq2exrz9xjumnvujw7zmav4r3vhfj9rvmd0aytjx0xesvzlmn48ctgqnqdgaan0ahmcfw3cpq5nxvnczzfhhvl3hmsps683cap4y696qecs7wejl3`

### How will those funds be used?

Donations sent to the Silent Payment address are personal contributions to individual members of The Wasabi Wallet Developers, a collective of contributors to the Wasabi Wallet project.

The funds are distributed fairly among active contributors based on their work in improving and maintaining the software, documentation, or other related efforts.
Even new contributors may receive a share of the donations.

Each contributor is individually responsible for handling their tax obligations according to the laws of their jurisdiction regarding personal donations.

### How should I start contributing to Wasabi?

Thank you for considering to support this beautiful libre and open-source project!
It is the responsibility of everyone using the software to contribute to its growth.
Your help is deeply appreciated, and very much needed!
First please read the [contribution checklist](/building-wasabi/ContributionChecklist.md) to get introduced to the project and to start out in the right direction.
Join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/tumblebit/shared_invite/enQtNjQ1MTQ2NzQ1ODI0LWIzOTg5YTM3YmNkOTg1NjZmZTQ3NmM1OTAzYmQyYzk1M2M0MTdlZDk2OTQwNzFiNTg1ZmExNzM0NjgzY2M0Yzg) and check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi), so that you can stay up-to-date with the latest contributions.

### How can I report a bug?

Code is speech, and can never be perfect.
Thus it is expected that there are many known and unknown bugs, quirks and issues in Wasabi.
Such a complex software requires constant and rigorous review by the developers and the users, this is everyone's responsibility working with Wasabi.

When you stumble upon an issue that needs fixing, please first check the open [issues](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/issues/) and [pull requests](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/pulls) if there is already someone working on it.
If yes, then you can comment your situation and bug report under the open issue.
If no, then please consider to [open a new issue](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/issues/new?template=bug-report.md) and give a detailed report on the problem.
It is especially helpful when you provide a step-by-step guide on how to reproduce what you have found.
There is constantly a lot of work done to the code base, thus it's good to know which version of Wasabi, and what operating system you are using.
In some cases it might be useful to see your logs, though please consider your privacy and encrypt this data properly in direct communication with the developers.

:::danger
If you find a bug that puts users' privacy or security at serious risk, please take great care with responsible disclosure!
Send an email to [adam.ficsor73@gmail.com](mailto:adam.ficsor73@gmail.com), preferably using PGP encryption [21D7 CA45 565D BCCE BE45 115D B4B7 2266 C47E 075E](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/blob/master/SECURITY.md).

### How can I request a feature?

Wasabi is a quite beautiful piece of software already.
Yet there are also 1001 things that could be just a little better, or even quite substantially superior.
The beauty and bane of libre and open-source software is that it is never complete, there is always more work to be done.

Regardless if you are a new user of Wasabi, or a veteran black belt Wasabika, any suggestions on how to improve are very welcome.
Please first check the existing [issues](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/issues/) and [pull requests](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/pulls) if someone has the same feature request as you.
If yes, then you can comment your desired improvement under the open issue.
If no, then please consider to [open a new issue](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/issues/new?template=feature-request.md) and give a detailed request.
It makes sense to first explain the problem you have in the incumbent version of Wasabi, this is the place to express your frustrations and annoyances.
Then describe the solution that you have envisioned, with all the nuances and details of how this would fix your problem.
To flesh our your argument, please consider alternatives and different approaches to this feature request.

### How can I get help and support?

You are already on the right track by first checking [this documentation](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io) for the knowledge you are seeking.
It's likely that you are not the first person who has an issue or a question, and hopefully someone has curated the answer in here already.
You can use the search function in the top navbar to look for a specific topic, and the sidebar menu as a table of content.
You can also use our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/discussions/5185) to find solutions to different issues and to ask questions if necessary.
If your trouble is specific to the code, then it might also be suitable to check the existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/issues/) and open a new one.

### What does the Wasabi project need help with?

Wasabi is libre and open-source software, thus it relies on the support of several contributors on all fronts.
Of course, this includes coding new features, bug fixes and stability improvements.
Yet just equally important is the review of the commits of all other Wasabikas.
It's not just the contributions to the code, but also to the documentation and the effort to educate peers using Wasabi.
This includes education in meatspace tribe gatherings, but also in cyberspace peer support.
So basically, we need help with building and shilling Wasabi!

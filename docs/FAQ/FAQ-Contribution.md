# Contributions to Wasabi

## Donations

### Why should I donate?

Wasabi is Free Open Source Software (FOSS).
No service is provided, and therefore it doesn't generate any revenue.
However, maintaining and improving the software requires ongoing effort, such as maintenance, continuous research, bug fixes, testing, documentation, regular updates, etc...

While Wasabi is one of the best tools available to use Bitcoin privately, achieving flawless financial sovereignty is still a work in progress.
There are many features yet to be implemented, and your support can help make them a reality.

Additionally, contributors cover static costs, such as server expenses and release management, using their personal funds.

By donating, youâ€™re directly supporting the developers who work tirelessly to maintain and improve Wasabi Wallet and make Bitcoin privacy accessible for everyone.

### How I can donate?

You can support The Wasabi Wallet Developers by:

- Clicking the `Donate` button found in the Wasabi application search bar
- Sending funds to their Silent Payment address: `sp1qq2exrz9xjumnvujw7zmav4r3vhfj9rvmd0aytjx0xesvzlmn48ctgqnqdgaan0ahmcfw3cpq5nxvnczzfhhvl3hmsps683cap4y696qecs7wejl3`

### How will those funds be used?

Funds sent to the Silent Payment address are personal donations to individual members of The Wasabi Wallet Developers, a collective of contributors to the Wasabi Wallet project.

The funds are distributed fairly among active contributors based on their work in improving and maintaining the software, documentation, or other related efforts.
Even new contributors may receive a share of the donations.

Each contributor is individually responsible for handling their tax obligations according to the laws of their jurisdiction regarding personal donations.

### How should I start contributing to Wasabi?

Thank you for helping support this beautiful libre and open-source project!
It is the responsibility of everyone using the software to contribute to its growth.
First please read the [contribution checklist](/building-wasabi/ContributionChecklist.md) to get introduced to the project and to start out in the right direction.
Join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/tumblebit/shared_invite/enQtNjQ1MTQ2NzQ1ODI0LWIzOTg5YTM3YmNkOTg1NjZmZTQ3NmM1OTAzYmQyYzk1M2M0MTdlZDk2OTQwNzFiNTg1ZmExNzM0NjgzY2M0Yzg) and check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi), so that you can stay up-to-date with the latest contributions.

### How can I report a bug?

When you stumble upon an issue that needs fixing, please first check the open [issues](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/issues/) and [pull requests](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/pulls) if there is already someone working on it.
If yes, then you can comment your situation and bug report under the open issue.
If no, then please consider to [open a new issue](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/issues/new?template=bug-report.md) and give a detailed report on the problem.
It is especially helpful when you provide a step-by-step guide on how to reproduce what you have found.
There is constantly a lot of work done to the code base, thus it's good to know which version of Wasabi, and what operating system you are using.
In most cases, it is necessary to see your logs.
Please consider your privacy by omitting sensitive log data like transaction IDs.

### How can I request a feature?

Regardless if you are a new user of Wasabi, or a veteran black belt Wasabika, any suggestions on how to improve it are appreciated.
Please first check the existing [issues](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/issues/) and [pull requests](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/pulls) if someone has the same feature request as you.
If yes, then you can comment your desired improvement under the open issue.
If no, then please consider to [open a new issue](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/issues/new?template=feature-request.md) and give a detailed request.
It makes sense to first explain the problem you have in the incumbent version of Wasabi, this is the place to express your frustrations and annoyances.
Then describe the solution that you have envisioned, with all the nuances and details of how this would fix your problem.
To flesh out your argument, please consider alternatives and different approaches to this feature request.

### How can I get help and support?

You are already on the right track by first checking [this documentation](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io) for the knowledge you are seeking.
It's likely that you are not the first person who has an issue or a question, and hopefully someone has curated the answer in here already.
You can use the search function in the top navbar to look for a specific topic, and the sidebar menu as a table of content.
You can also use our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/discussions/5185) to find solutions to different issues and to ask questions if necessary.
If your trouble is specific to the code, then it might also be suitable to check the existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WalletWasabi/issues/) and open a new one.

### What does the Wasabi project need help with?

Wasabi is libre and open-source software, thus it relies on the support from many talented contributors.
This includes coding new features, bug fixes, and stability improvements.
Yet just equally important is the review of the commits of all other Wasabikas.
It's not just the contributions to the code, but also to the documentation and the effort to educate peers using Wasabi.
This includes education at Bitcoin meetups, conferences, and within online communities.
So basically, we need help with building and shilling Wasabi!

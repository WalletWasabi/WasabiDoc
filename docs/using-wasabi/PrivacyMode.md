## More information on Privacy Mode
- In Privacy Mode the wallet is still usable, which means input field information isn't hidden.
- Privacy Mode only masks the surface.
This means if you request sensitive information to be seen in Privacy Mode, for example like clicking on an expander, Privacy Mode won't hide the content.
- Some justification of design decisions can be seen [here](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/2234).

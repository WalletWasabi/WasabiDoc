## More information on Discreet Mode
- In Discreet Mode the wallet is still usable, meaning that you can send and receive payments, as well as coinjoin.
- Discreet Mode only masks the surface.
This means if you request sensitive information to be seen in Discreet Mode, for example like clicking on an expander, Discreet Mode won't hide the content.
- Some justification of design decisions can be seen [here](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/2234).

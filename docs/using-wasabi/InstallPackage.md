# Install package

[[toc]]

---

It is strongly recommended to **VERIFY PGP SIGNATURES** of the downloaded packages before installing Wasabi. This protects you against malicious phishing sites giving you back-doored Wallet software.
Don't trust - Verify!

Download the packages either from the official [WasabiWallet.io](https://wasabiwallet.io/) clearnet website, or for your privacy's sake, from the official tor hidden service [http://wasabiukrxmkdgve5kynjztuovbg43uxcbcxn6y2okcrsg7gb6jdmbad.onion/](http://wasabiukrxmkdgve5kynjztuovbg43uxcbcxn6y2okcrsg7gb6jdmbad.onion/).

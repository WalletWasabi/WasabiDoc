## More information on Discreet Mode
- In Discreet Mode the wallet is still usable, meaning that you can send and receive payments, as well as coinjoin.
- Discreet Mode only masks the surface.
This means that when you click to see more Details, some information (which wasn't visible at first) will be shown.
- When hovering over the ### chars with the cursor, the content will be visible for a short amount of time.
- Some justification of design decisions can be seen [here](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/2234).

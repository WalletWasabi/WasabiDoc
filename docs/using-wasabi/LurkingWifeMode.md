# Lurking Wife Mode (LWM)

Lurking Wife Mode is an exclusive Wasabi Wallet feature that hides sensitive and critical information from physical observers and allows you to post screenshots without worrying about your privacy.

## How to activate Lurking Wife Mode
You can activate LWM from Settings or by clicking on your wallet balance in the top right corner. 

## More information on LWM
- In LWM the wallet is still usable, which means input field information isn't hidden.  
- LWM only masks the surface. This means if you request sensitive information to be seen in LWM mode, for example like clicking on an expander, LWM won't hide the content.
- Some justification of design decisions can be seen here: [https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/2234](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/2234)

# Shielded Screen Mode (SSM)

Shielded Screen Mode is an exclusive Wasabi Wallet feature that hides sensitive and critical information from physical observers and allows you to post screenshots without worrying about your privacy.

## How to activate Shielded Screen Mode
You can activate SSM from Settings or by clicking on your wallet balance in the top right corner. 

## More information on SSM
- In SSM the wallet is still usable, which means input field information isn't hidden.  
- SSM only masks the surface. This means if you request sensitive information to be seen in SSM mode, for example like clicking on an expander, SSM won't hide the content.
- Some justification of design decisions can be seen here: [https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/2234](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/issues/2234)

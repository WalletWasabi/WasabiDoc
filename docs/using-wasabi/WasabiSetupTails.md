# Wasabi Setup on Tails

[[toc]]

---

This essay is extracted from this step by step [guide](https://github.com/PulpCattel/Tails-BitcoinCore-Wasabi), which also includes tutorials on how to install Tails, create a persistent storage and use Bitcoin Core alongside with it.

## CREATE ADMIN PASSWORD

You need sudo privileges to install Wasabi, at “Tails Greeter” create your admin password in “additional settings” and launch Tails.

## DOWNLOAD

Download for Debian/Ubuntu from:  
http://wasabiukrxmkdgve5kynjztuovbg43uxcbcxn6y2okcrsg7gb6jdmbad.onion (tor hidden service)  
or  
https://www.wasabiwallet.io/#download

Verify the PGP signature of the downloaded package, the zkSNACKs' PGP key fingerprint is:  
`6FB3 872B 5D42 292F 5992 0797 8563 4832 8949 861E`

`gpg -v Wasabi-X.X.X.deb` (For more details check this [guide](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/InstallPackage.html#debian-and-ubuntu))

You can now save your `Wasabi-X.X.X.deb` into the persistent storage, which should look like this:

`/Persistent`  
&emsp; `/bitcoin-0.18.1` (Bitcoin Core launcher folder)  
&emsp; `/Bitcoin` (Bitcoin Core data folder)  
&emsp; `/Wasabi-X.X.X.deb` (Wasabi installer)

## WASABI DATA FOLDER

As of version 1.1.9 Wasabi doesn’t offer easy ways, especially without command line, to change install directory. There is though a quick workaround.

Wasabi saves session files in `/Home/.walletwasabi/client`, you need to mark the “show hidden files” setting to see it.

Create a directory in your persistent with the same hierarchical structure, like this:

`/Persistent`  
 &emsp; `/bitcoin-0.18.1` (Bitcoin Core launcher folder)  
 &emsp; `/Bitcoin` (Bitcoin Core data folder)  
 &emsp; `/Wasabi-X.X.X.deb` (Wasabi installer)  
 &emsp; `/.walletwasabi`  
 &emsp; &emsp; `/client` (here we save our wallet files, filters and blocks)

After every session, when you’re done, navigate into `/Home/.walletwasabi/client` and copy the desired folders into your persistent directory.

Generally, you’d like to save the `Wallets` and `Blocks` folders.

The former contains your wallet information (e.g. keys, labels), while the latter includes the blocks needed to establish your balance.

Could be also nice to save the `BitcoinStore` folder, which contains the BIP 158 block filters, so that you don’t have to download them again.

## INSTALL WASABI

Drop the `Wasabi-X.X.X.deb` file from `/Home/Persistent` into desktop.

Open the terminal and run:

```
cd Desktop
sudo dpkg -i Wasabi-X.X.X.deb
```

Type the password you created at “Tails Greeter”.

([Info](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/dpkg.html) about dpkg)

Wasabi will show as a normal application in your activities overview menu, ready to start.

* Press [Windows key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_key)
* Type "wasabi"
* Launch it

## LOAD FROM YOUR DATA DIRECTORY

After the first time you save a Wasabi session, your persistent storage will look like:

`/Persistent`  
&emsp; `/bitcoin-0.18.1` (Bitcoin Core launcher folder)  
&emsp; `/Bitcoin` (Bitcoin Core data folder)  
&emsp; `/Wasabi-X.X.X.deb` (Wasabi installer)  
&emsp; `/.walletwasabi`  
&emsp; &emsp; `/client` (here we save our wallet files, filters and blocks)  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/Wallets` (wallet files)  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/Blocks` (blocks)  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/BitcoinStore` (filters)

To load your saved session, drop the `.walletwasabi` folder into `/Home` before starting Wasabi.

You can save multiple copies of `.walletwasabi` in your persistent, each with different data:

`/Persistent`  
&emsp; `/bitcoin-0.18.1` (Bitcoin Core launcher folder)  
&emsp; `/Bitcoin` (Bitcoin Core data folder)  
&emsp; `/Wasabi`  
&emsp; &emsp; `/Wasabi-X.X.X.deb` (Wasabi installer)  
&emsp; &emsp; `/BitcoinStore` (No need to keep multiple copies of same filters)  
&emsp; &emsp; `/CoinJoin wallet`  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/.walletwasabi`  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/client` (here we save our wallet files, filters and blocks)  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/Wallets` (wallet files)  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/Blocks` (blocks)  
&emsp; &emsp; `/watch-only coldstorage A`  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/.walletwasabi`  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/client` (here we save our wallet files, filters and blocks)  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/Wallets` (wallet files)  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/Blocks` (blocks)  
&emsp; &emsp; `/watch-only coldstorage B`  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/.walletwasabi`  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/client` (here we save our wallet files, filters and blocks)  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/Wallets` (wallet files)  
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; `/Blocks` (blocks)

This is only a minor example, tune it to your own needs.

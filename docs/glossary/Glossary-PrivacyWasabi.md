## Privacy and Wasabi

:::details
### Address Reuse

Address reuse refers to the use of the same address for multiple transactions, this is very bad for privacy.
Read more: [Address reuse](/using-wasabi/AddressReuse.md)

:::details
### Anonymity Set (anonset)

The anonymity set is effectively the size of the group you are hiding in during a CoinJoin.
It's the quantity of equal value outputs of one CoinJoin transaction.

:::

:::details
### Block filters

A filter representing a compact list of addresses in one block.
Wasabi checks locally if any block filter contains transactions with addresses of the wallet.
No public keys are sent to any third party server, thus it is very private.
Read more: [BIP 158: Compact Block Filters for Light Clients](/using-wasabi/BIPs.md#bip-158-compact-block-filters-for-light-clients)
:::

:::details
### Blockchain Analysis

Blockchain analysis is used by transaction surveillance companies to follow the transaction history of coins.
Techniques like the common-input-ownership heuristic or change detection are used to create a cluster of transactions belonging to one user.

:::

:::details
### Bloom Filter

A filter used primarily by SPV clients to request only block headers and merkle proofs of a given transaction from full nodes.
This is very bad for privacy, as third party servers learn about which addresses you are interested in.
Read more: [BIP 37: Connection Bloom Filtering](/using-wasabi/BIPs.md#bip-37-connection-bloom-filtering)
:::

:::details
### Change Address Detection

Many Bitcoin transactions have change outputs.
It would be a serious privacy leak if the change address can be somehow found, as it would link the ownership of the (now spent) inputs with a new output.

:::details
### Chaumian CoinJoin

A Chaumian CoinJoin is a special type of CoinJoin that utilizes Chaumian [or Schnorr] blind signatures to prevent the central coordinator from spying on the linkage between inputs and outputs.

:::

:::details
### Cluster

Which entities know about which coins.
For example, this coin belongs to a cluster that is known by Coinbase and Alice.

:::

:::details
### CoinJoin (CJ)

CoinJoin is a trustless method for combining multiple Bitcoin payments from multiple spenders into a single transaction to make it more difficult for outside parties to determine which spender paid which recipient.
Read more: [What is a CoinJoin?](/FAQ/FAQ-Introduction.md#what-is-a-coinjoin)
:::

:::details
### CoinJoined coins

Coins that have successfully participated in a CoinJoin (with the exception of the change) and thus lose their association to a previous cluster.

:::details
### Coin Control

Coin control is a must learn if you care about your privacy in Bitcoin.
As can be understood from the name, this is a proper control of one's coins.

:::

:::details
### Common-Input-Ownership heuristic

This is a heuristic or assumption which says that if a transaction has more than one input then all those inputs are owned by the same entity.

:::details
### Coordinator

The coordinator is a server which creates CoinJoins and accepts UTXOs in the mix.

:::

:::details
### Dust

Dust is an UTXO that is uneconomical to spend.
Also, small portions of bitcoin can lead to serious consequences for one's privacy, for example the so called `forced address reuse attack`.

:::details
### Know Your Customer (KYC)

KYC (Know Your Customer) is the process of a business being forced to identify and verify the identity of its clients, and to share this information with a government.
The term is also used to refer to the bank regulation which governs these activities.

:::

:::details
### Label

A way to track who knows about the ownership of your coins.
Not to be confused with a description of a transaction.

:::

:::details
### Lurking Wife Mode (LWM)

Lurking Wife Mode is a Wasabi feature that hides sensitive and critical information on the wallet itself, which is useful for screenshots.

:::details
### Pay to EndPoint (P2EP)

Pay to EndPoint is sending of bitcoins where the receiver adds one of his own coins as input for a two party CoinJoin.

:::

:::details
### Peers

Peers in our documentation refers mainly to Bitcoin and Wasabi Wallet users, but it also means people.
They are literally peers in the network, or in the CoinJoin.

:::details
### XPUB (Extended Public Key)

An xpub, also know as Extended Public Key, is a part of BIP-32 that will allow you to observe your wallet without the private key (xpriv).

:::details
### Taint

Taint is equivalent to the 'trail' that a Bitcoin transaction leaves during the course of its journey.
The taint analysis of a Bitcoin transaction evaluates the association between an address involved in the chain of transactions.

### The Onion Router (Tor)

Tor (The Onion Router) is free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication.
It is widely used by Wasabi.

### Tumbling / Tumbler

Tumbling is a synonym of 'Mixing'.
Similarly, Tumbler is the synonym of 'Mixer'.

:::details
### Transaction Surveillance Company

A transaction surveillance company is one which attempts to spy on all Bitcoin users.
Their business model is usually to sell the data to any government, corporation or individual willing to pay for their services.

:::details
### #twoweeks

The #twoweeks is a fun inside joke often used in the Wasabi documentation and, more generally, in the Internet community.
In the case of Wasabi documentation, it usually indicates the arrival of a new function or update, to which the future date is still uncertain.

Eg. "Lightning Network is coming to Wasabi in #twoweeks"
:::

:::details
### Wallet fingerprinting

A careful analyst sometimes deduces which software created a certain transaction, because many different wallet softwares don't always create transactions in exactly the same way.

:::details
### Wasabika

Wasabikas are builders, users and supporters of Wasabi in general.

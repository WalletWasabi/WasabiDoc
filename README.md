# Wasabi Wallet 2.0 Documentation

[Wasabi Wallet](https://wasabiwallet.io) is an open-source, non-custodial, privacy focused Bitcoin wallet for desktop. It implements a trustless privacy technique, called [WabiSabi CoinJoin](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/206).

This is Wasabi Wallet's open-source [documentation](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io) repository.
Here you will find information about the nuances of privacy in Bitcoin, how Wasabi solves some of the existing problems, and how you can use this tool to defend yourself.

## VuePress

The [Wasabi documentation website](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io) is built using an open-source static site generator called VuePress.
Its [configuration](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WasabiDoc/blob/master/docs/.vuepress/config.js) and [theme](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WasabiDoc/tree/master/docs/.vuepress/styles) are extremely customizable, and it offers great defaults out-of-the-box.
Check out the [VuePress website](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/) for details on how to use it.

To contribute to the content of the website, you can make PRs related to the markdown files in the `/docs/` directory, and if merged, the changes will automatically be integrated into the documentation website by VuePress.
Know that you do not need to understand/deal with VuePress at all in this case.

## Writing Conventions

- Wasabi [capitalized]
- coinjoin [not capitalized, one word]
- WabiSabi [capitalized, one word]
- Every sentence must start in a new line.
- For a paragraph, add an `empty line` or `<br>` in the markdown.

## Reference files

Please consider this repository structure for hyperlinks, and use relative links whenever possible, for example:

```
[What is a coinjoin?](FAQ-Introduction.md#what-is-a-coinjoin)
```

## Embedding images

The images are stored in the [`/docs/.vuepress/public/`](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WasabiDoc/tree/master/docs/.vuepress/public) directory.
They can be embedded via the following markdown tags:

```
![Alternative text of the image](/IMAGENAME.png "Title of the image")
```

## Embedding videos

Youtube videos and playlists can be embedded via the following custom markdown tags:

```md
[![Title of the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID)
```

Optionally you can also specify the start position of a video in seconds (e.g. starts at 100 seconds):

```md
[![Title of the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID?t=123)
```

And the index of the video of a playlist (e.g. starts the third video):

```md
[![Title of the playlist](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID?list=PLAYLIST_ID)
```

If the image doesn't appear, that usually happens with older videos, use hqdefault.jpg instead of maxresdefault.jpg

In case that the thumbnail doesn't fit well with the documentation, a default image can be added as custom thumbnail, located at `/Logo_without_text_with_bg_dark_with_yt.png`.
Currently, all thumbnails have been set to this default image as a temporary solution because videos are old, sometimes not under our control, and the thumbnails were irrelevant.

## Text Highlights

There are three types of text highlights that can be used to display different colored boxes.

A green box displaying a [friendly tip](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/PasswordBestPractices.html):

```
:::tip
foo
:::
```

A yellow box with a [cautious warning](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/WalletRecovery.html#back-up-wallet-file-and-password):

```
:::warning
foo
:::
```

A red box with a [clear danger](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/ExternalRestore.html), you can also add a title `foo` to any container:

```
:::danger foo
bar
:::
```

## Frequently asked questions

Use this markdown box with the headers to write the FAQ:
```
### question

answer answer answer.
answer answer answer.
```

## Variables

To have a single place to maintain universal strings like the current Wasabi version number, we use variables in the Markdown (i.e.  `${currentVersion}`and `${zksnacksPublicKeyFingerprint}`).
These variables are managed in [`docs/.vuepress/config.ts`](https://github.com/WalletWasabi/WasabiDoc/blob/master/docs/.vuepress/config.ts).
Occurrences of `${variableName}` get substituted before the Markdown is processed.

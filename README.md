# Wasabi Documentation

[Wasabi Wallet](https://wasabiwallet.io) is an open-source, non-custodial, privacy focused Bitcoin wallet for desktop. It implements a trustless privacy technique, called [Chaumian CoinJoin](https://github.com/nopara73/ZeroLink/).

This is Wasabi Wallet's open-source [documentation](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io) repository.
Here you will find information about the nuances of privacy in Bitcoin, how Wasabi solves some of the existing problems, and how you can use this tool to defend yourself.

## Contribute to the Documentation

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/zkSNACKs/WasabiDoc/_apis/build/status/zkSNACKs.WasabiDoc?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/zkSNACKs/WasabiDoc/_build/latest?definitionId=4&branchName=master)

Just like the Wasabi wallet software, this documentation is libre and open-source under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
Not only do we appreciate everyone's contribution, but we desperately need it!

### VuePress

The [Wasabi documentation website](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io) is built using an open-source static site generator called VuePress.
Its [configuration](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WasabiDoc/blob/master/docs/.vuepress/config.js) and [theme](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WasabiDoc/tree/master/docs/.vuepress/styles) are extremely customizable, and it offers great defaults out-of-the-box.
Check out the [VuePress website](https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/) for details on how to use it.

To contribute to the content of the website, you can make PRs related to the markdown files in the `/docs/` directory, and if merged, the changes will automatically be integrated into the documentation website by VuePress.
Know that you do not need to understand/deal with VuePress at all in this case.

### Writing Conventions

- Wasabi [capitalized]
- CoinJoin [capitalized, one word]
- Every sentence must start in a new line.
- For a paragraph, add an `empty line` or `</br>` in the markdown.

### Reference files

Please consider this repository structure for hyperlinks, and use relative links whenever possible, for example:

```
[What is a CoinJoin?](FAQ-Introduction.md#what-is-a-coinjoin)
```

### Embedding images

The images are stored in the [`/docs/.vuepress/public/`](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WasabiDoc/tree/master/docs/.vuepress/public) directory.
They can be embedded via the following markdown tags:

```
![Alternative text of the image](/IMAGENAME.png "Title of the image")
```

### Embedding shields

To insert the shield images inline with the text, use these HTML tags:

```html
<img src="/ShieldCheckmark.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet green checkmark shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet green checkmark shield anonymity set" class="shield" />
<img src="/ShieldGreen.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet green shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet green shield anonymity set" class="shield" />
<img src="/ShieldYellow.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet yellow shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet yellow shield anonymity set" class="shield" />
<img src="/ShieldRed.png" alt="Wasabi Wallet red shield anonymity set" title="Wasabi Wallet red shield anonymity set" class="shield" />
```

### Embedding videos

Youtube videos and playlists can be embedded via the following custom markdown tags:

```md
@[youtube](VIDEO_ID)
@[youtubePlaylist](PLAYLIST_ID)
```

Optionally you can also specify the start position of a video in seconds (e.g. starts at 100 seconds):

```md
@[youtube](VIDEO_ID,100)
```

And the index of the video of a playlist (e.g. starts the third video):

```md
@[youtubePlaylist](PLAYLIST_ID,VIDEO_ID)
```

### Text Highlights

There are three types of text highlights that can be used to display different colored boxes.

A green box displaying a [friendly tip](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/PasswordBestPractices.html):

```
:::tip
foo
:::
```

A yellow box with a [cautious warning](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/WalletRecovery.html#back-up-wallet-file-and-password):

```
:::warning
foo
:::
```

A red box with a [clear danger](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/using-wasabi/RestoreElectrum.html), you can also add a title `foo` to any container:

```
:::danger foo
bar
:::
```

### Frequently asked questions

Use this markdown box with the headers to write the FAQ:
```
:::details
### question

answer answer answer.
answer answer answer.
:::
```

When you want to [highlight text](README.md#text-highlights) within a question, then you need to [nest containers](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-container/issues/6#issuecomment-213789283) by adding more `:` for the outer block start/end. The outer `details` container has now four `::::`, and the inner `warning` container has still three `:::`.

```
::::details
### question

answer answer answer.

:::warning
answer answer answer.
:::
::::
```

### Variables

To have a single place to maintain universal strings like the current Wasabi version number, we use variables in the Markdown (i.e.  `${currentVersion}`and `${zksnacksPublicKeyFingerprint}`).
These variables are managed in [`docs/.vuepress/variables.js`](https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WasabiDoc/blob/master/docs/.vuepress/variables.js).
Occurrences of `${variableName}` get substituted before the Markdown is processed.

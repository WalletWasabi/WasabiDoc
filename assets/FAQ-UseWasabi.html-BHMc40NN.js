Essentially, all nearby nodes are passed your transaction, and those nodes will pass to all of their nearby nodes, etc. However, if a malicious adversary were to get enough relay nodes in the network, they could pretty easily connect the initial location of a transaction by simply observing from which node the transaction appeared first. For this reason, broadcasting transaction through your own node may reveal your IP address.</p><p>So to fix this, Wasabi broadcasts your transaction to a random node over Tor, so this node cannot detect your IP address. When you want to send another transaction, Wasabi destroys the original Tor circuit and establishes a new Tor identity and connection with a brand new node.

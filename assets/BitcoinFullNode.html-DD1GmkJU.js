Wasabi will show up as one of the connected peers while it is downloading a block. You can check this in the Bitcoin Core / Knots GUI by clicking on <code>Window -&gt; Peers</code>. During the period when Wasabi is fetching a block, it will show up in the <code>User Agent</code> column. Alternatively, you can use the Bitcoin RPC call <code>bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo</code> and see the Wasabi client listed.</p>',13);function k(x,W){const i=l("router-link"),a=l("ExternalLinkIcon");return c(),r("div",null,[f,e("nav",y,[e("ul",null,[e("li",null,[n(i,{to:"#the-importance-of-running-a-full-node"},{default:t(()=>[o("The importance of running a full node")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[n(i,{to:"#how-does-wasabi-use-your-bitcoin-full-node"},{default:t(()=>[o("How does Wasabi use your Bitcoin full node")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[n(i,{to:"#using-an-already-existing-local-bitcoin-full-node"},{default:t(()=>[o("Using an already existing local Bitcoin full node")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[n(i,{to:"#using-an-already-existing-remote-bitcoin-full-node"},{default:t(()=>[o("Using an already existing remote Bitcoin full node")]),_:1})]),e("li",null,[n(i,{to:"#verify-that-wasabi-is-connected-to-your-full-node"},{default:t(()=>[o("Verify that Wasabi is connected to your full node")]),_:1})])])]),b,p,g,m,e("p",null,[o("There are several software implementations that function as a full node, for example, "),e("a",w,[o("Bitcoin Core"),n(a)]),o(", "),e("a",_,[o("Bitcoin Knots"),n(a)]),o(", or "),e("a",v,[o("LibBitcoin"),n(a)]),o(".")]),B])}const I=s(h,[["render",k],["__file","BitcoinFullNode.html.vue"]]),T=JSON.parse('{"path":"/using-wasabi/BitcoinFullNode.html","title":"Bitcoin Full Node","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Bitcoin Full Node","description":"Information and step-by-step guides on how to use your own Bitcoin Core full node together with Wasabi Wallet.

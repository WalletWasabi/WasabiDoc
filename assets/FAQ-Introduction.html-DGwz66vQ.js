Numerous fungibility improvements have been proposed; however, none of them have addressed the privacy issues in full. WabiSabi is designed so that no participant, outside observer or even the coordinator can spy on the user. The scope of WabiSabi is not limited to a single transaction, it extends to transaction chains and it addresses various network layer deanonymizations. However, its scope is limited to Bitcoin&#39;s first layer. Even if an off-chain anonymity solution gets widely adopted, ultimately the entrance and exit transactions will always be settled on-chain. Therefore, there will always be need for on-chain privacy.</p><p>Ideal fungibility requires every Bitcoin transaction to be indistinguishable from each other, but it is an unrealistic goal. WabiSabi&#39;s objective is to break all links between coins. Thus, WabiSabi enables the usage of Bitcoin in a fully anonymous way.</p>',11),we={href:"https://github.com/zksnacks/wabisabi",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},ye=e("h3",{id:"what-are-the-supported-operating-systems",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#what-are-the-supported-operating-systems"},[e("span",null,"What are the supported operating systems?")])],-1),ge={href:"https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/WasabiCompatibility.md#officially-supported-operating-systems",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},ke=e("h3",{id:"what-are-the-minimal-requirements-to-run-wasabi",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#what-are-the-minimal-requirements-to-run-wasabi"},[e("span",null,"What are the minimal requirements to run Wasabi?")])],-1),_e={href:"https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/WasabiCompatibility.md#officially-supported-operating-systems",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},We={href:"https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/tree/master/WalletWasabi.Daemon",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function ve(xe,Te){const o=r("ExternalLinkIcon"),i=r("RouteLink");return c(),d("div",null,[p,e("p",null,[t("Every single line of code in Wasabi, the "),e("a",b,[t("wallet"),a(o)]),t(", the "),e("a",m,[t("backend server"),a(o)]),t(", the "),e("a",f,[t("daemon"),a(o)]),t(", the "),e("a",w,[t("tests"),a(o)]),t(", the "),e("a",y,[t("packager"),a(o)]),t(", the "),e("a",g,[t("library"),a(o)]),t(", the "),e("a",k,[t("api"),a(o)]),t(", the "),e("a",_,[t("documentation"),a(o)]),t(" - has always been and will always be libre and open-source under the "),e("a",W,[t("MIT license"),a(o)]),t(".

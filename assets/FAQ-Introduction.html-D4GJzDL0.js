Numerous fungibility improvements have been proposed; however, none of them have addressed the privacy issues in full. WabiSabi is designed so that no participant, outside observer or even the coordinator can spy on the user. The scope of WabiSabi is not limited to a single transaction, it extends to transaction chains and it addresses various network layer deanonymizations. However, its scope is limited to Bitcoin&#39;s first layer. Even if an off-chain anonymity solution gets widely adopted, ultimately the entrance and exit transactions will always be settled on-chain. Therefore, there will always be need for on-chain privacy.</p><p>Ideal fungibility requires every Bitcoin transaction to be indistinguishable from each other, but it is an unrealistic goal. WabiSabi&#39;s objective is to break all links between coins.

As a result, wallets that use the coinjoin service a lot have a quickly growing set of generated addresses. This is a problem for wallet synchronization: each address has to be tested against each filter, with a small probability of matching as false-positive for every address. As a result, wallets with many derived addresses will have to download many false-positive blocks, making the synchronization more time consuming.</p><p>It leverages a simple heuristic: addresses used as coinjoin outputs or as change (internal keys) should only be used once. In other terms, once an internal address has been used to receive a coin and then this coin was used as input in a new transaction (the coin has been spent), the address should never be used again, and there is no need to test it against the remaining filters.</p><p>Wallets coinjoining a lot will benefit the most from this feature, as the vast majority of their addresses will be skipped, reducing the number of blocks to download because of false-positive matches.</p><p>Once the wallet is opened, the skipped addresses will be tested in the background, in the case that some funds have been received on those addresses.
